Introduction
=============
This repository contains all software used in the Spring 2015
take-home midterm for MCE 647 Robot Dynamics and Control at 
Cleveland State University under the supervision of Dr. Hanz Richter.  

The LaTeX source code is available in the 
repository for reference **MCE647_Midterm.tex**.  
    
Instructions
=============

To obtain the results presented in the paper, the source code 
may be downloaded and unzipped.  Intuitively, all code associated
with the parameterization method and projection method have been 
separated in their respective folders.  

- The parameterization method can be run through the main code **runParamOpt.m**
- The projection method can be run through the main code **Midterm_takehome_rev4.m**
