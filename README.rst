is available in the repository for reference.  
    
Instructions
=============

To obtain the results presented in the paper, the source code 
may be downloaded and unzipped.  Intuitively, all code associated
with the parameterization method and projection method have been 
separated in their respective folders.  

- The parameterization method can be run through the main code `runOpt3.m`
- The projection method can be run through the main code `Midterm_takehome_rev4.m`
