| The PDF of the associated report and the LaTeX source code 
is available in the repository for reference.  
    
Instructions
=============

To obtain the results presented in the paper, the source code 
may be downloaded and unzipped.  Intuitively, all code associated
with the parameterization method and projection method have been 
separated in their respective folders.  

- The parameterization method can be run through the main code **runParamOpt.m**
- The projection method can be run through the main code **Midterm_takehome_rev4.m**

Software Dependencies
======================

Parameterization Method
-----------------------
    
- MATLAB Version 8.0.0.783 (2012b)
- Optimization Toolbox Version 6.2.1
- Symbolic Math Toolbox Version 5.9 

Projection Method
------------------

- MATLAB Version 8.1.0.604 (2013a)
- Optimization Toolbox Version 6.3

- Symbolic Math Toolbox Version 5.10 


Key File Description
======================

Parameterization Method
-----------------------
Stand alone scripts:    

- **runParamOpt.m**: Main File for running optimization (Start Here for Parameterization Method)
- **estError.m**:  Script used to calculate estimated error. 
- **makeDHFunctions.m**: Script for generating DH functions for the PUMA Robot e.g. transA5_0.m

Helper functions:

- *circleParam.m*:  Function for a circle
- *equationSet.m*:  Function containing equation set used in optimization (generated by runParam)
- *hmc3_transRotX/Y/Z.m*: Function used for performing transformations
- *HRx/y/z.m*: Function used in building DH matrices
- *lineParam.m*: Function for a line
- *objFun.m*: Objective Function for the optimization
- *plotResults.m*: Creates animation of optimization
- *rot_jac_mat*: Function for the derivation of a general linear and angular velocity Jacobian
- *unpackSymbolics*: Match a set of values returned from a symbolic function to list of symbolic variables and place them in a structure.
